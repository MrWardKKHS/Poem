Casarolls aren't cool
They aren't the best
They look out the window a lot 
But sometimes they scratch your face
They preach to let you know they're hangry!
Dogs are not like cats
Dogs are the best

Their tails wag
Some dogs are floofy.
Floof is the best.
But dogs are big and they can scare children


But they are so cute and love pats
Frodo would have a cat but it would knock 
The one ring off the table

For funny.

I have a Vizsla at home. She is the best dog. A good dog.

I have a sibling who is very clingy
And a cat that likes pats
A dog that jumps from logs
Just like tadpoles and frogs
That live in bogs
And trees with leaves that sway in the breeze

Cats are sometimes cool
They are sometimes the best
They also have kittens
Kittens are small

Mountains are cool
even cold
They're the tallest things I know.

Mountains are tall
Mountains are small 
Mt Everest is the tallest of them all

Ollie is nonchalant and extremely cool
He is the tallest of them all
When I see someone towering over a wall
I know Ollie is in range for a call
