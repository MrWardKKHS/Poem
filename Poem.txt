Cats are cool
They are the best
They look out the window a lot 
But sometimes they scratch your face
They purr to let you know they're happy!
Dogs are not like cats
Their tails wag
But dogs are big and they can scare children

Ode to all the short people
without them where would we be?
They make great stepstools
for getting cats outta trees

Bad omens to the tall people
who make me wanna hurl
they can't get old ladies to say
"would you like some candy little girl"

hail to all the munchkins
who are always "in the way"
if ya' drop your lipstick behind the couch
it's the short people who'll save the day

Evil curses upon all the giants
whose feet stink like smelly trash
when you're head is so high up there
can you see all the people you smash

yay for all the small ones
who always have the best car
Barbie and Honda power wheels
a ride like that'll get you far

cold shoulder to all the large ones
whose heads shoot up to the sky
you wanna fly like the angels
but face it, you're too big to fly

Congradulate the short people
cause in the end they are tall
body size doesn't matter 'cause
in the end, the true tall people are all

The ones who recieve less brain damage when they fall.
